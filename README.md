# Task Manager API

A Node.js and Express.js backend application that provides user authentication, task management, and rating functionality.  
Users can sign up, log in, and manage tasks securely with JWT-based sessions.  
Password security is ensured through hashing, and MongoDB aggregation is used for advanced data processing in at least one endpoint.
